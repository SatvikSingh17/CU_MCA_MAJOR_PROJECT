<H3><U>CU MCA JULY-23 BATCH MAJOR PROJECT</U></H3>

This web application is based on a Transfer Learning Technique - ResNet-50, trained to recognise different types of Brain Tumours from Brain MRI images. The neural network achieved accuracy exceeding 98.86% on the relevant test set of more than 1300 brain MRI images. Please note that the predictive accuracy of the model, depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. Therefore the model has limitations and cannot be used for definite clinical predictions! Instead it can be used for research and comparison purposes (please see notes below).
